* Description:  populates the given matrix with a random ASCII

*		- Land is represnted by pound-symbols '#' (boulders?)
*		- "Air" is always above "Land", so each column of
*		   the image from bottom-to-top has some number of
*		   Land symbols above which is just air.
*		- As long as these rules are followed, the matrix 
*		  is valid.
*
* Estimated Difficulty:  LEVEL 2

  Notice that a column may be all "land" (no air); similarly, a column 
  can be all air (no land).  This means that even the following are

  These might be improbable, but the point is that you don't have 
  to "prevent" them somehow.

* Function:  sink

*               Row N-1 "disappears"
*               Row 0 becomes "Air"
*
* Estimated Difficulty:  LEVEL 2.5

*               pattern is a substring of s.

*
*		Otherwise, -1 is returned (note that a match could
*		start at index 0, so we can't use 0 for "false").
*
* Estimated Difficulty:  LEVEL 3
*
*		Examples:

*   NOTES:  
*		- every string is a substring of itself
*		- if the pattern is longer than the source string,
*		   of course there can be no match.
*		- remember there may be multiple matches - you want
*		   the index of the first match.
*
*   RULES:  You may use the strlen library function (but you don't
	    really need it) but all other library functions 
	    operating on strings are off limits!
